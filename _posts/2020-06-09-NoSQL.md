# Why NoSQL
Relational database has been existed since 1970s, data storage in database is well-organized, records are organized into tables, a table consists of rows, which identified by primary keys. The data in database is normalized and distributed into many tables, they are linked and joined together depending on business demand by using SQL query.
The fact is that joining is costly in term of computation, schema is one of artifact in RDBMS, which requires to know before accessing data. The most disadvantage of RDMB is data structure storage and scaling since it is limited in the world of data processing and data science and it becomes difficult to scale if data volumes become bigger and bigger.


# In order to workaround and minimize this advantage
- De-normalization: It allow to avoid joining many tables by expanding the number of columns to store data on single table, so we only query on single table, that would improve read performance, but it will introduce the possibility of data anomalies.

- Sharding: This is another technique which breaks up database, and store pieces of information on different servers. With this technique, we can query from subset data, we don’t need to query entire data. Therefore, this improves both read and write performance, but it will be more complex to organize and manage.

- Replication: We could replicate or copy data, and then store them in different servers. This really improves read performance, but we need to concerns about inconsistencies between copies.

NoSQL database has been emerged to address the week points of RDBMS. 

NoSQL provides flexibility, adapt to changing requirements while its scalabilities is to meet the requirement of storage in analytic or big data project.
The advantage of NoSQL as follows
- Flexible schema: It provides flexibility, not fixed in metadata definition, we don’t need to provide the exact definition and how database look like like normalization of data relationship modeling. Most of NoSQL database provide a simple storage with key-value structure.

- Distributed data: Data is now stored and distributed across multiple servers, also it enables parallel processing of read/write across multiple servers without creating a bottleneck. In addition, we can increase the size of cluster if needed depending on amount of data.

- Replication: Basically the ideas are similar to RDBMS is to replicate or save multiple copies of data in many servers. It is helpful to avoid bottleneck and improve performance when many users query database or workload increase. However, having said that the trade-off is that the more replication, the more complicated we manage or tune data.

Therefore, both distributed data or replication is used to address performance in database once workload increase or many users access to database while flexible schema (means no schema) provide flexible storage in database with key-value structure. 


# Type of NoSQL database
There are 4 types of NoSQL database including key-value database, document database, wide column database, and graph database.

## Key-value database
It works as dictionary with a key which is used to look up value. Some database like Redis, this is really useful for caching, and improving performance, but it is not really valuable for data science.

## Document Database
If there are many rows in table, there are many documents in collection in this database. In each document, it can store as structure of multiple key-value, key can be scalar with simple data types like string or integer, while value can be more complex structure like list or arrays even binary BOB.

## Wide Column
Wide column means column can be extensible, not fixed, so we can add column on the fly even each row has different column each inside a table. Like document, value on each column can be complex structure.
Therefore, data in this database is denormalized, although it uses terms table or column in relational database.

## Graph Database
Basically, this is network and graph in data structure, it includes 2 parts entities and links. The entities have relationship through a link. The link is also called an edge or a path which has properties that is used to query entities.
